<h1>World of Warcraft</h1>

<p>I'm quite a fan of <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a>, having raided fairly actively since Vanilla. As a result I have a few different projects related to it.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>I occasionally blog about WoW-related topics on <a href="http://world-of-theorycraft.tumblr.com/">World of Theorycraft</a>.</p>

<p>To accompany <a href="http://www.saate.net/general/rngg/rng-stories-winner/">a discussion</a> about my addon <i>Bunny Hunter</i>, I wrote a piece on drop rates and probabilities in WoW - <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/beating-the-rng/">World of Warcraft - Beating the RNG Boss</a>.</p>

<p>More recently I wrote about hunter theorycrafting, specifically <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/survival-haste-plateau-myth/">the myth of the Survival haste plateau</a>. Still can't get away from theorycrafting.</p>

<h2>World of Map Craft</h2>

<p>In 2012 I released <a href="http://worldofmapcraft.com/">worldofmapcraft.com</a>, containing slippy-maps for Azeroth and all battlegrounds, dungeons and raids released up to Cataclysm.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/world-of-mapcraft/">wrote about the process</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iamcal/World-of-MapCraft">released the source code</a>. It was covered by lots of gaming news sites including Kotaku, Massviely, Escapist and EuroGamer.</p>

<h2>Hunter Loot</h2>

<p>I created <a href="http://hunterloot.com">hunterloot.com</a> to help determine how useful any given piece of gear is to different hunter specs. It scrapes gear and enchant data from the armory and wowhead to create an index of each slot. It's a very useful quick index and a decent replacement for the spreadsheet (it doesn't take into account bonuses, but it handles trinket procs and hit capping).</p>

<p>Hunter Loot can be used in conjunction with <a href="http://femaledwarf.com/">Female Dwarf</a> to determine stat weightings for your exact spec, gear and talents. Create a profile on Female Dwarf first, and then click through to Hunter Loot to get personalized, automatically updating gear recommendations.</p>

<p>From Nov 2008 to Nov 2011 Hunter Loot displayed gear recommendations for over 350,000 different Hunter builds.</p>


<h2>Game Addons</h2>

<p>All of my addons can be automatically installed via the <a href="http://wow.curse.com/client">Curse Client</a>. That way you'll automatically get updates too.</p>

<h2>Saate.net</h2>

<p>I created the software that powers the weekly <a href="http://www.saate.net/category/jumbles/">Jumbles</a> on <a href="http://www.saate.net/">Saate.net</a>. It's one of my favorite WoW blogs, focusing on obsessive play. Definately worth a read. And the weekly jumble challenge is fun.</p>


<h2>Rawr</h2>

<p>I re-wrote and maintained the Hunter Module for <a href="http://rawr.codeplex.com/">Rawr</a> during the 2.2.* releases. At the time, it was a 100% match for the spreadsheet; I submitted back several pacthes for bugs in the rotation simulation code, pet talents and lots of little issues which can be found <a href="http://hunterloot.com/misc/bugs_closed.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, the module was rewritten breaking most calculations and should not be used. Either use the spreadsheet (which now has a gear optimizer, which is a reasonable substitute) or the web app <a href="http://femaledwarf.com/">Female Dwarf</a> which is excellent.</p>

<h2>Other code</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/iamcal/GuildInfo">GuildInfo</a> is a simple web app I put together in around 2008 as a way to collect together the photos from my guild. It grew to include achievements, stats and quests as Blizzard opened up the armory for the first time.</p>

<p>When I started leading 25 man raids, tracking attendance for our zero-sum-DKP-with-bonsues system became difficult. I created <a href="https://github.com/iamcal/AttendanceTracker">AttendanceTracker</a> as a simple tool to let me quickly enter raid events (players joining and leaving, boss kills, starting rosters, etc) and getting a better picture of attendance over time.</p>

<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/iamcal/RaidTracker">RaidTracker</a> once my guild started using HeadCount for attendance and loot tracking. It's a simple web frontend to HeadCount data, allowing you to view who killed what and which items were looted.</p>
