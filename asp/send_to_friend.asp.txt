    " & senderName & " (" & "senderEmail & ") came across the {siteName} site at
    {siteURL} and figured you'd like it too!

    The site is full of animations that range from twisted to just 
    plain silly as well as a few games. It's funded entirely by 
    donations and people buying t-shirts so if you like it please
    offer it whatever support you can. 

    " & senderName & " wrote this message for you:

    " & comments & ";

    If you believe you have received this email in error then please
    contact {siteContact} and let me know!

    Also, please note that I cannot be held responsible for the comments
    added by the sender. If they're an arse then you really shouldn't have
    given them your email address should you?
