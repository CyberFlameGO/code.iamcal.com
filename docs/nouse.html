<h1>The <code>nouse</code> programming language</h1>
<p>
<code>nouse</code> is pronounced like noose.  It is spelled
<code>nouse</code> because it's not useful.
</p>
<p>
The inspiration for creating this language came while reading a
description of Befunge, in which the flow of control can go left,
right, up, or down in a torus.  So I figured it would be even more
perverse if the flow of control depended on something like the current
size of the stack.
</p>
<p>
The <code>nouse</code> virtual machine consists of a ring of bytes and
a stack of bytes.  Execution continues as long as the instruction ring
is not empty, and begins at instruction 0 with an empty stack.
</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
Each byte in the ring is an instruction.  Each instruction is composed
of two parts.  The byte modulus 7 specifies the instruction.  The byte
divided by seven specifies the skip multiplier.
</p>
<h4>The skip</h4>
<p>
The skip of the instruction is the skip multiplier multiplied by size
of the stack before the operation is executed.
</p><blockquote>
For example, if the instruction is <code>write 4</code>, where
<code>write</code> is the operation, and <code>4</code> is the skip
multiplier, and if the stack contains 3 bytes, then the skip is 12.
</blockquote>
The skip is used to determine the next instruction and, if necessary,
the operand of the instruction.  The <code>read</code>,
<code>write</code>, and <code>swap</code> operations have no operand,
and, when the stack is empty, the <code>add</code> and
<code>test</code> operations become noops with no operand.  When there
is no operand, the next instruction is determined by skipping skip
bytes after the current instruction.  When there is an operand with
the <code>add</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>add</code> operations,
the operand location is determined by skipping skip bytes after the
current instruction, and the next instruction is determined by
skipping skip bytes after the operand location.  The
<code>cut</code>, <code>paste</code>, and <code>swap</code> operations
change the instruction ring; the descriptions of these operations will
specify how the operand and next instruction are determined from the
skip.
<p></p>
<h4>The operations</h4>
<p>
The operations are
</p><ul>
<li>0: <code>cut</code>: Push contents of the operand location onto
the stack, then remove the operand location from the ring.  The next
instruction is determined by skipping skip bytes after the removed
location.
</li><li>1: <code>paste</code>: If the stack is not empty, the top of the
stack popped and inserted into the ring after skipping skip bytes, in
other words, it is inserted just before the normal operand location,
then, the next instruction is determined by skipping skip bytes after
the newly inserted byte.  If the stack is empty, a copy of the
contents of the operand location is inserted.
</li><li>2: <code>read</code>: Read one byte from the input channel, and
push it on the top of the stack.  If at the end of file, the stack is
not changed.
</li><li>3: <code>write</code>: If the stack is not empty, write the top of
the stack to the output channel.  The stack is not changed.
</li><li>4: <code>add</code>: If the stack is not empty, replace the top of
the stack with the sum of the top of the stack and the contents of the
operand location.
</li><li>5: <code>test</code>: If the stack is not empty, compare the top
of the stack with the contents of the operand.  If they are equal, pop
the top of the stack.
</li><li>6: <code>swap</code>: Swap the contents of the ring and the
stack.  The current location, (containing this <code>swap</code>
instruction), becomes the bottom of the stack.  The bottom of the
stack becomes the current location, and the next instruction is
determined by skipping skip bytes.  Note that the skip is determined
before the swap occurs, from the skip multiplier of the original
instruction and the size of the original stack.
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>
There are two syntaxes: the assembly syntax, and the line-noise
syntax.  The simple interpreter in OCaml and the interpreter in C
support only the line-noise syntax.  The fancier interpreter in OCaml
supports both syntaxes, and can convert between the two.
</p>
<h4>Assembly syntax</h4>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>tokens consist of unbroken strings of lowercase or digit characters
</li><li># to end of line is a comment, acts as a separator, and is
otherwise ignored
</li><li>all characters other than #, lowercase characters, or digits are
separators, and are otherwise ignored
</li><li>each instruction is either a (decimal) number or a token with the
name of an operation and a number
</li><li>a numerical instruction becomes that number modulus 256 in the
instruction ring
</li><li>a valid operation token plus a number becomes an instruction with
the operation set to the specified operation, and with the multiplier
set to the number
</li><li>invalid multipliers, those greater than 36 or 35, depending on the
operation, are ignored
</li><li>invalid tokens are ignored
</li><li>operations between an operation and its multiplier are ignored
</li><li>operations without multipliers at the end of the program are ignored
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Line-noise syntax</h4>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>instructions are made of two characters, the first specifies the
operation, and the second specifies the multiplier.
</li><li>the operations are specified by <code>#:&lt;&gt;+?^</code>
<!--"()<>+#:^"-->
</li><li>multipliers of 0 to 9 are specified by <code>0</code> to
<code>9</code>.
</li><li>multipliers of 10 to 35 are specified by <code>a</code> to
<code>z</code>.
</li><li>multiplier of 36 is specified by <code>_</code>, which is ignored
if the operation doesn't allow that multiplier
</li><li><code>#</code> for <code>cut</code> is inspired by an ancient tty
setting for delete
</li><li><code>:</code> for <code>paste</code> is inspired by the cons
operator
</li><li><code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for <code>read</code> and
<code>write</code> is inspired by sh redirects
</li><li><code>+</code> for <code>add</code> is obvious
</li><li><code>?</code> for <code>test</code> is obvious
</li><li><code>^</code> for <code>swap</code> is inspired its use as xor,
which can be used to swap bits
</li><li>invalid characters are ignored
</li><li>operations between an operation and its multiplier are ignored
</li><li>operations without multipliers at the end of the program are ignored
</li></ul>

  </li></ul>
</li><li>Another "Hello world!"
  <pre>#0^0#0&gt;0#0+0#0:4#0&gt;0#0+0#0#1#0&gt;0#0&gt;0#0+0#0&gt;0#0&gt;0#0+0#0&lt;p#0&gt;0#0+0#0&gt;c#0
&gt;0#0+0#0&gt;z#0&gt;0#0+0#0&gt;0#0&gt;0#0+0#0?z#0&gt;0#0+0#0&gt;z#0&gt;0#0+0#0#r#0&gt;0#0+0#0?x
#0&gt;0#0+0#0:_#0&gt;0#0+0#0:z#0^0#2#0#0#2#e&lt;a^0
  </pre>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Ideas for adding perversity</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>More perverse ways of calculating the skip based on the current
state, which include the stack size, the stack contents, the ring
size, the ring contents, and even the previous skip.
</li><li>Begin with a stack with the same contents as the ring.
</li></ul>
